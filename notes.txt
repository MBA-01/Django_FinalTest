create a new App inside the global folder.


as chagpt explained, these apps are used for different purposes.

as they are totally autonomous apps working for a certain purpose and have a goal to achieve 


Models (Blueprints): Think of models as blueprints for the different parts of your castle. 
For example, you might have blueprints for towers, walls, and rooms. 
In Django, you create models to describe the different things you want in your web app, like users, posts, or comments.

Views (Windows): Views are like windows in your castle. 
They show people different parts of your castle when they look through them. 
In Django, views are like the different pages or sections of your web app that people can see.

Templates (Decorations): Templates are like decorations inside your castle. 
They make things look nice and organized. 
In Django, templates are used to make your web app pages look good by adding colors, images, and arranging things neatly.

URLs (Signposts): Imagine you have signposts outside your castle that tell visitors where to go. 
In Django, URLs are like signposts that help direct people to the right views (windows) in your web app.

Forms (Magic Scrolls): Sometimes you want your visitors to leave a message or input some information. 
Forms are like magic scrolls that help your visitors send messages to your castle. 
In Django, forms help you collect and process information from users.

Admin (Magic Wand): Django also gives you a magic wand called the admin panel. 
With this, you can easily manage and organize everything in your castle without having to do a lot of coding.
